Ok, so the issue now is fractional hz. doesnt seem to be supported. ---> is now!
there's still some discrete stepping, there's always going to be ints in there somewhere, but it's much smoother

...and, same issue with "volume," which is really duty cycle. sick harmonics! however, now it's not linear. fine.

ok, now this thing is a real pwm.

these are all going to start up at the same time, so there needs to be a chip-based offset

data should be different lengths
